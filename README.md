# Sac-Generator
Generates Sacs and checks if they are unused.
I dont plan on updating it, Just doing this for fun whilst waiting for my friend to get back from being afk im ngl


How it works;

It downloads a word list of 350k words
each word is checked 
if works it goes into working_sacs.json
if not working goes into unused_sac.json

how to use it; 

npm i axios

thanks to krows for giving me the idea, love you
